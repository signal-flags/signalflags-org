    <h3>Main design</h3>
    <p>
      Our goal was to design flags and pennants that look like the ones we use
      for running sailing races. The designs therefore have an outline so that
      all images stand out on a white background, and the colours are chosen to
      be easy to distinguish whilst looking natural on the screen and in print,
      including a slight grey shade to 'white' elements.

    <h4>Letters</h4>

    <p>
      Letters and other flags in this set are rectangular (4Ã—3); for square
      designs as well as designs without outlines
