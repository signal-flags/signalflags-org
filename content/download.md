## Extract the image files

Software to extract zip archives is built in to many operating systems including
Windows, MacOS, and most flavours of Linux.

## Locate the images you want

Images are stored in folders according to their 'type' (flag, pennant or
triangle) and design as in the table below.

For example the Answering Pennant in the standard 3:1 aspect ratio with a border
like this: {{< sf/inlineFlagImg ap >}} is located at
[`sf-pennant-outline/ap.svg`](/sf-pennant-outline/ap.svg).

|                                     | A-Z and other flags            | 0-9 and answering pennants      | substitutes                      |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| With outlines                       | `sf-rectangle-outline`         | `sf-pennant-outline`            | `sf-triangle-outline`            |
| Alternative shapes                  | `sf-square-outline`            | `sf-short-outline`              |
| Without outlines                    | `sf-rectangle-no-outline`      | `sf-pennant-no-outline`         | `sf-triangle-no-outline`         |
| Alternative shapes without outlines | `sf-square-no-outline`         | `sf-short-no-outline`           |
| Primary colours without outlines    | `sf-square-no-outline-primary` | `sf-pennant-no-outline-primary` | `sf-triangle-no-outline-primary` |

## Use an image in a document

This is often as simple as selecting the image you want and 'dragging' it into
the document, or selecting 'Insert Image' from a menu.
